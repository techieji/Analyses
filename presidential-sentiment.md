# An Analysis on the Sentiment of the Presidential Candidates

You hear a lot about the presidential candidates, don't you? One thing that you hear a lot is how negative President Donald Trump is. I set myself to see whether or not this is true, with actual proof, not just a statement with examples. And surprisingly, I found evidence!

The above graph compares subjectivity (y-axis), how much opinion there is in a piece of text, vs polarity (x-axis), how positive or negative a piece of text is. I pulled 100 of President Trump's tweets, 100 of Former Vice President Biden tweets, and 100 random tweets about the election. Then, I plotted each of these groups on a graph. The blue line is an estimation of each group.

Immediately, you can see something wrong with President Trump's graph: his blue line heads into the upper left corner while Joe Biden and the random people's tweets heads into the upper right corner. What does this mean? When a dot is on the left side of the graph, this means that the tweet is negative. When a dot is on the right side, the tweet contains positive information. When a tweet is near the top, that means that the tweet is primarily opinion. When a tweet is near the bottom, that means that the tweet is mostly fact. Using this new understanding, let us analyze the graph.

The blue line for all three graphs starts from the bottom near zero polarity. This is expected; a fact shouldn't be positive or negative. In all three graphs, the subjectivity increases with the polarity (the more opinion in a tweet the happier its content will be) up until when the subjectivity measures 0.4. At this point, Trump's graph veers to the left and into negative polarity while Biden's keeps climbing upward. What is going on here? Why does Trump's graph go negative?

When you read a few of Trump's tweets and a few of Biden's tweets, you can get an answer of some sort. Trump's campaign relies on how he is better than the alternative. The logical way to get this point across is to raise the other sides negative aspects to light. Biden, on the other hand, tweets very positive messages, although they are fairly repetitive. 

So what can we *do* with this graph? By analyzing a person's tweets, you get insight into a person's mind. In my opinion, this data implies that Trump is a negative person, while Biden is a positive person who can comfort the American people. But it depends on the person interpreting the data.
