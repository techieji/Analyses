# An Analysis on the Sentiment of the Presidential Candidates

You hear a lot about the presidential candidates, don't you? One thing that you hear a lot is how negative President Donald Trump is. I set myself to see whether or not this is true, with actual proof, not just a statement with examples. And surprisingly, I found evidence!

The above graph compares subjectivity, how much opinion there is in a piece of text, vs polarity, how positive or negative a piece of text is. I pulled 100 of President Trump's tweets, 100 of Former Vice President Biden tweets, and 100 random tweets about the election. Then, I plotted each of these groups on a graph. The blue line is an estimation of each group.
