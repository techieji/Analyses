# Analyses

This repository contains the source code and data for many different analyses which I maintain. Note that the code in here is not always up to date. Also note that the
files here will have moderately descriptive names, but that is it. I do not guarantee any form of reproducability; you will get weird errors if you try to clone this repo
and run the code.

## Files

 * **Experiments.ipynb**: A [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) containing the election analyses
 * **NJHS.ipynd**: another jupyter notebook containing materials related to education
 * **education.xslm** and **education.py**: A macro-enabled spreadsheet and a python file that work together (most of the time) using [xlwings](https://xlwings.org)
